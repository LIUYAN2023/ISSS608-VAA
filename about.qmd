This website consists of a collection of works done for the **ISSS608-Visual Analytics and Applications** course I took in my MITB journey. And the visualization work is done with Tableau, R packages and Shiny app.

There are three types of exercise:

-   **Hands-on Exercise**

Trying out new visualization skills and technique before coming to class based on reading material provided from the textbook, documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics.

-   **In-Class Exercise**

In-class exercise is mainly on Tableau or R visualization works practice during class and guided by Prof. Kam Tin Seong.

-   **Take-home Exercise**

Take-home exercise focuses using innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualization for analytics purposes.
