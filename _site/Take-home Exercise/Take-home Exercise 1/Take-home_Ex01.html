<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</p>
<p>This exercise aims to reveal the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement by using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods. User-friendly and interactive solution will help planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.</p>

<p>To conduct a comprehensive analysis of participant demographics and their financial status, we implemented following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform a grouping operation on the “FinancialJournal” using the “participantId” and “category” variables, to obtain each participant’s monthly expenditure across different categories.</p></li>
<li><p>Reshape the new table to “Financial_wide”. Each row of “Financial_wide” contains one participant’s financial expenditures and income information.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge the “Financial_wide” and “Participants” tables by the “participantId” variable, creating a new table “joined_table” that contains comprehensive information on participant demographic, expenditures, and income.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-variable-wrangling">2.3.3 New Variable Wrangling</h3>
<p>To better utilize the available variables, we create several new variables as part of our data analysis process.</p>
<p><code>Total_Expenditure</code>: aggregating all monthly expenditures on education, food, recreation, and shelter. This variable provides insight into the overall cost of living for each participant.</p>
<p><code>Saving_Ratio</code>: the difference between wage and total_expenditure divided by wage. This variable is a useful indicator of financial health and reflects the proportion of income that is being saved or invested for future needs.</p>
<p><code>age_bin</code>: binning the “age” variable into discrete categories based on the following age ranges: “&lt;=30”, “&gt;30 - 40”, “&gt;40 - 50”, and “&gt;50”. This variable serves as a categorical variable and enables us to analyze the characteristics of different age groups.</p>
<p><code>Wage_bin</code>: binning the “wage” variable into income categories based on the following ranges: “&lt;3000”, “3000 - &lt;4000”, “4000 - &lt;5000”, and “&gt;=5000”. This variable serves as a categorical variable and facilitates the analysis of different income groups.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Test of Association between</strong> <strong>Wage_bin vs educationLevel:</strong></p>
<p>The result of this test suggests that there is a significant association between the variables “Wage_bin” and “educationLevel” in the dataset, as indicated by the low p-value (p=2.82e-69) and the high value of the <code>X2pearson</code> statistic (X2pearson(9)=346.91).</p>
<p>The <code>V ̂cramer</code>statistic also indicates a moderate degree of association (V ̂ cramer =0.36). The <code>CI95%</code>[0.32,1.00] suggests that there is a 95% chance that the true value of the association between these variables falls within this interval, with a lower bound of 0.32 and an upper bound of 1.00.</p>
<p>Finally, the Nobs value of 880 indicates that there were 880 observations used in the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Insight:</strong></p>
<p>1. There is a significant association between “Wage_bin” and “educationLevel” in the dataset.</p>
<p>- Nearly half of the survey participants belong to the high school or college student, or low education group, who report a relatively lower average monthly income.</p>
<p>- Graduates have the highest representation in the high income group, followed by those with a bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>2. There is no association between the variables “Wage_bin” and ” Age_bin”, with P value = 0.44.</p>
<p>3. There is a significant association between the variables “Wage_bin” and ” haveKids” in the dataset, people tend to have kids when they have a relatively higher income.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Ratio vs Education Level:</strong> it can be observed that graduates have the highest mean saving ratio, while those with low education level have the lowest mean saving ratio. Moreover, it is worth noting that there is a higher presence of outliers for the group of graduates.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Ratio vs Have Kids:</strong> the box plot indicates that both groups, i.e., those with and without kids, have similar mean and median saving ratios. However, the dispersion, as measured by the interquartile range, is smaller for the group of individuals who have kids.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Ratio vs Household Size:</strong> the box plot reveals that the median saving ratio for households with two people is lower compared to those household size with one or three people. Additionally, the group with one person in the household has the largest dispersion of saving ratios.</p>

<p><strong>Total Expenditure vs Education Level:</strong> the mean monthly living cost does not vary significantly among different education levels. Besides, the dispersion of the monthly living cost is smaller for individuals with a lower level of education and for those with a high school or college degree, compared to those with a bachelor’s or graduate degree.</p>
<p><strong>Total Expenditure vs Have Kids :</strong> In comparing the mean monthly living costs of demographic groups with and without children, it was found that households with children experience a higher mean average monthly cost of living compared to those without.</p>
<p><strong>Total Expenditure vs household size :</strong> it can be observed that as the household size increases, the total living cost also increases.</p>

<p>These results suggest that there are significant correlations between joviality and the variables of Saving_Ratio, Recreation, and Food, but a weaker correlation with Wage.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The p-values for all four tests are very small, indicating a low likelihood of obtaining such strong correlations by chance.</p></li>
<li><p>The signs of the correlation coefficients suggest that as Recreation, and Food increase, Joviality tends to increase as well, whereas for saving ratio and Wage, Joviality tends to decrease as these two variables increases.</p></li>
<li><p>The correlation coefficient rPreason measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables. In this case, a value of -0.56, -0.3, 0.55, and 0.57 respectively suggests a moderate to strong negative correlation for Saving_Ratio and Wage, and moderate to strong positive correlation for Recreation and Food.</p></li>

<p>Before performing the necessary hypothesis testing, we need to choose between parametric and non-parametric test. perform Anderson-Darling test with confidence level of 95% to test the null hypothesis that the joviality by different factor(education_level,age,have kids, interestGroup) is normally distributed.</p>

<p>Based on the result above, the null hypothesis is rejected as some of the distributions are below 0.05 critical value. As such, we are not able to confirm normality assumption for distribution of joviality by education_level/age/have kids/ interestGroup).</p>
<p>```</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There was a significant association between joviality and education level, as indicated by a X2Kruskal-Wallis test statistic of 13.50 with a p-value of 3.67e-03.</p></li>
<li><p>The effect size (e^2 ordinal) was 0.02, suggesting that education level accounted for a small but meaningful proportion of the variation in joviality scores.</p></li>
<li><p>The 95% confidence interval for the effect size ranged from 6.53e-03 to 1.00, indicating a relatively wide range of possible effect sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>There were no significant associations found between joviality and age and having kids:</p>
<p>-For age, the X2Kruskal-Wallis test statistic was 5.72 with a p-value of 0.13, and the effect size (e^2 ordinal) was 6.51e-03 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.51e-03 to 1.00.</p>
<p>-For having kids, the X2Mann-Whitney test statistic was 81868 with a p-value of 0.28, and the effect size (r_ordinal^rank) was 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.04 to 0.13.</p></li>
